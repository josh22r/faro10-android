            <p>The idea for Faro10 occurred to me a few years ago when my wife, Tracy, and I met with our daughterâ€™s
               therapist to evaluate her progress. Our daughter suffered from severe depression, suicidal thoughts and
               sudden fits of anger. She had visited several therapists and tried different medications, and we were
               still left with uncertainty in her diagnosis. At this particular appointment, the therapist asked our
               daughter how she had felt over the past few weeks and if she thought the medication helped.

            <blockquote class="left-pull" style="background-color: #326867">
               <p style="color: white" >... There was nothing tangible to review.</p>

            <!--<p style="color: #B4D336" >...There was nothing tangible to review.</p>-->
            <!--<br>-->
            <p>Not surprisingly, our teenage daughter responded with a simple shrug and "I dunno." There was nothing
               tangible to review, but the entire appointment rested on our ability to remember how she "felt" over the
               past several weeks. The therapist recommended increasing the dosage of medication due to the lack of improvement.
               The therapist explained that medications react differently from person-to-person, and there was little
               understanding about how to predict which medication would work best. The therapist also emphasized the
               serious side-effects of the medication. From that place of frustration and concern, the Faro10 concept was born.

         <h3>Josh & Tracy
         </h3>
         <p>
            Tracy and I are high school sweethearts and have been married for 17 years with two beautiful daughters.
            <!-- Tracy is an office manager at a local small business, and I am a dData eEngineering cConsultant. -->
            This is a very personal cause for us, as we have been directly impacted by two close family members struggling
            with mental illness. Not only with our daughter, but also Tracy's brother who is bipolar and schizophrenic;
            the several years of struggle he endured before his doctors found the right medication and dosage was incredibly
            hard on the entire family. It is a helpless feeling for family members to stand by and watch someone you care
            for fall apart. As I thought about what I could do to help, I began to realize how many others are affected by
            this same issue.

         <p>
            <b>Crowdsourcing | Identify novel discovery through data mining of real patient information</b><br>
            Our long-term vision is to better understand what medications and treatment work best for a particular person based on symptoms and biology.
            This predictive and prescriptive approach can reduce time to diagnose, improve understanding of medication
            options, predict response to medication/treatment, and greatly improve the quality of care.
            <br><br>
            <b>Data Aggregation | Create a treatment outcome datastore to be mined for novel discovery</b><br>
            To create a treatment outcome datastore large enough (with quality data) to be mined for novel discovery, a
            centrally managed behavioral health outcome management (BHOM) system is needed that is beneficial to both patients
            and clinicians.  Faro10 provides useful tools that improve caregiving capability, while simultaneously building
            this datastore that will improve in usefulness over time.
            This system of scale will continually improve in insightfulness and predictive ability as patients and clinicians adopt the BHOM tools.<br><br>
            <b>Multiple Applications | Faro10 provides tools to address mental health from three different perspectives.  Patient, Clinician and Observers.</b><br>
            <i>Patient</i> application and mobile app for users to track their health, symptoms, journal, prescription tracking and more.<br>
            <br />
            <i>Clinician</i> application helps manage patients and their symptoms, provides visibility into treatment progress
            and outcomes, and presents feedback from patient and observers.<br>
            <br />
            <i>Observer</i> application for friends/loved ones of a patient to provide input to patient charts <i>(patients often don't make the best historians)</i>.
            These observations are available to the patient's clinician, but not visible to the patient.  The observer can
            also be permitted to view the patient's prescription tracking,
            to assist in reminding the patient to take medication and record.<br><br>
            <b>Usability Example | Using Faro10 with my daughter and her clinician</b><br>
            We have found the observer functionality to be especially useful in improving the quality of conversations during
            sessions.  My wife and I both provide regular observations on the behavioral status and symptoms of our daughter
            using Faro10.   Our daughter does not see any of these comments, but her clinician is able to use this information during sessions.
